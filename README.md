# Amsterdam-Housing-Prices
A machine learning-powered web app that estimates the market value of a house based on its features.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation comes from [Kaggle: Amsterdam House Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thomasnibb/amsterdam-house-price-prediction), originally published by Thomas Nibb.  
The dataset includes housing information such as living area, number of rooms, geographic coordinates, and sale prices.  
I used it to explore price trends in Amsterdam, engineer features (scaling numerics and encoding postal codes), and train machine learning models.
